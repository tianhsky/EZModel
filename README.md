# EZModel
Generate models and schema.rb from existing database just in one command line. If you prefer design ER diagram and export scripts to generate database schema, or if you have to work with a legacy database, this can save you insame amount of time. All you need to do is to have a database.yml configuraiton file in ~/config/. Besides creating all models it sets proper table name and primary key if tables and columns naming doesnâ€™t follow Rails convention. It also tries to read all foreign keys data from a database.     

It uses [Rmre](https://github.com/bosko/rmre "Rmre") as underlying reverse engine to generate models. I made some modifications to Rmre to support mysql2 adapter, and had those auto-generated model files placed in a subfolder inside ~/app/models/ez_models/ instead of the default ~/app/models/, so that regenerating models will not overwrite the existing ones. Over the times, db schema can ge changed, all it needs is to run the command again to regenerate models, developers can feel free to add methods to the models classes in ~/app/models/ without worrying about being overwritten.

## How to use it
###Prerequisite
####1. Setup database server, mysql is suggested;

####2. Setup database schema, if you already have a database set up, skip this step;
there are many tools can be use for database design, you can then export scripts to generate db schema;   
checkout mysql-workbench and its forward-engineering feature for more details about designing ER diagram and generate schema;    

####3. Prepare ~/config/database.yml, here is a sample:   

	development:
		adapter: mysql2
		reconnect: false
		database: MySchema_development
		pool: 5
		username: root
		password: "123456"
		socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
	test:
		adapter: mysql2
		reconnect: false
		database: MySchema_test
		pool: 5
		username: root
		password: "123456"
		socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
	production:
		adapter: mysql2
		reconnect: false
		database: MySchema_production
		pool: 5
		username: root
		password: "123456"
		socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

###Generate models
	# generate model files
	# it will take development as default db environment when environment is not specified  
	ezmodel -g
	#or
	ezmodel -g -e development

	# generate model files and overwrite existing ones in ~/app/models/
	# use this command only if the model files in ~/app/models/ don't inherit EZModel::ActiveRecord 
	# backup your models files is strongly suggested if you are not sure what it is doing
	# use it at your own risk
	ezmodel -g -o

	# see help
	ezmodel -h

	# see version
	ezmodel -v

## Installation
